**My First GitHub Project**

**Overview**
This is my first GitHub project. I created it to learn how GitHub works, including repositories, commits, and version control.

**What this project shows**
- I can create and manage a GitHub repository
- I understand how commits track changes
- I can add and edit files in a project
- I can write and organise basic Python code
- I can document a project using a README file

**Files in this project**
- `hello.py` – A simple Python script
- `README.md` – Project explanation
- `.gitignore` – Git ignore rules
- `LICENSE` – MIT License

**Why this project exists**
This repository is part of my learning process and serves as a foundation for future projects.
