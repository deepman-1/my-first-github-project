# My First GitHub Project

## Overview
This is my first GitHub project. I created it to learn how GitHub works, including repositories, commits, and version control.

## What this project shows
- I can create and manage a GitHub repository
- I understand how commits track changes
- I can add, edit, and organise project files
- I can write and improve basic Python code
- I can document a project clearly using a README

## Project files
- `hello.py` – A simple Python script with user input
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `NOTES.md` – Learning notes and reflections
- `.gitignore` – Git ignore rules for Python
- `LICENSE` – MIT License

## Why this project exists
This repository is part of my learning journey and serves as a foundation for future projects.
